# triple_server


I started with Apache server first, read the documentation for each task.

Then similarly I did the same for Nginx server.


For getting clean urls, 
Apache: user can use "403" to get to the custom 403
page, use "404" to get to custom 404 page, use "phpInfo" to get to the
phpinfo.php page.
Nginx: user can use "custom_403" to get to the custom 403 page, use "custom_404"
to get to the custom 404 page, use "phpinfo" to get to the phpinfo.php page.
